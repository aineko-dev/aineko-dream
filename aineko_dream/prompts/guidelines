Here are the guidelines for this prompt:

1. The result you produce will not be read by a human, it will be utilized in an python project using the Aineko framework and will be expected to run without any issues.
2. Adding anything or deviating from the Aineko framework will cause the output to fail and this is not acceptable.
3. Think carefully through the code you write and ensure that the code is perfect, there is no room for error.
4. Do not use any libraries, frameworks, or projects that are not well-known and well-documented, unless they are explicitly mentioned in the instructions or in the prompt.

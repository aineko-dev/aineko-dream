Based on the Aineko framework documentation provided and the customer's use case, here is a Python file with a Node class that writes "Hello, World!" 10 times.

```python
from aineko.internals.node import AbstractNode

class HelloWorldNode(AbstractNode):
    def _pre_loop_hook(self, params=None):
        """Optional; used to initialize node state."""
        self.count = 0

    def _execute(self, params=None):
        """Required; function repeatedly executes."""
        if self.count < 10:
            print("Hello, World!")
            self.count += 1
        else:
            self.activate_poison_pill()  # Terminate the pipeline after printing 10 times
```

This class, `HelloWorldNode`, inherits from the `AbstractNode` class provided by the Aineko framework. It overrides two methods: `_pre_loop_hook` and `_execute`.

The `_pre_loop_hook` method is used to initialize the state of the node. In this case, we initialize a counter `self.count` to 0.

The `_execute` method is the main logic that runs recurrently. Here, we check if `self.count` is less than 10. If it is, we print "Hello, World!" and increment `self.count` by 1. If `self.count` is not less than 10, we call `self.activate_poison_pill()` to terminate the pipeline, as we have printed "Hello, World!" 10 times.

Please note that this code does not produce or consume any data from a dataset, as the customer's use case does not require it. If your use case involves interacting with datasets, you can use `self.producers` and `self.consumers` as described in the Aineko framework documentation.
